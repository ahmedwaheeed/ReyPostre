Sprinkle 2 teaspoons coffee over each madeira cake mould. \n \nStep 3 \nUsing an electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add thickened cream and beat until just combined. Fold in half the Flake and remaining 1 tablespoon coffee. Spoon mixture into moulds and press down firmly.

Ceramic moulds (ramekins) take longer to chill than metal moulds (darioles), so refrigerate for 3 hours instead of 1 in step 3. \nTip: For an adult's version, replace the boiling water with warmed Kahlua or Bailey's Irish Cream."

Cook in six 125ml (1/2-cup) dishes or ramekins for 20 minutes or four 185ml (3/4-cup) dishes or ramekins for 25 minutes. Shallow dishes will take 3-5 minutes less time to cook. Microwave method: Use a round, 1.5-litre (6-cup), heatproof microwave-safe dish. Follow the recipe above to the end of step 4. Place a square piece of baking paper on the microwave turntable and elevate the dish on a microwave-safe rack 2cm above the turntable. Cook, uncovered, on Medium/500watts/50% for 8-9 minutes. If using a wider, shallower dish, it will take 2-3 minutes less time to cook. (If the centre seems a little undercooked, don't be tempted to cook the pudding for longer as it will continue to cook on standing due to the high sugar content.) Cover the pudding loosely with foil and set aside for 5-10 minutes before serving. Variation: ((( Caramel self-saucing pudding ))) Omit all the cocoa powder. Add 1 1/2 tbs golden syrup with the milk in step 3. Increase the butter to 60g (3 tbs). Melt 2 tbs extra golden syrup in the boiling water in step 4 before pouring over the pudding."
